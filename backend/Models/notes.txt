eventRSVP field changes:
originally wanted to refer to events via a "foreign key"
had trouble with that tho :/ had to scrap it but here's what it was before

in app.js:
app.post('/api/eventRSVPs',(req,res,next)=>{
  const rsvp = new EventRSVPModel ({
    // eventID: Number,
    eventID: {type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Event"}, // create "foreign key"
    rollCallNum: req.body.rollCallNum
  })
  rsvp.save()
});

in backend/Models/eventRSVP.js
// define eventRSVP schema
eventRSVPSchema = mongoose.Schema({
  // eventID: {type:Number, required:false}, // this is in addition to the id mongoDB automatically generates an objectID for documents
  eventID: {type:ObjectId, required: true}, // want this to be a foreign key (the randomly generated document ID from events collection)
  rollCallNum: {type:Number, required:true}
})
